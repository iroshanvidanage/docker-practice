# Multi-Service Multi-Node Web App

- A voting app for cats vs dogs


## Resources

- Create the following resources;
    - 2 Networks
    - 1 Volume
    - 5 Services

## Instructions

- Create two overlay networks `backend` & `frontend`.
- Create a db server with a volume mount.

## Services

- vote
  - bretfisher/examplevotingapp_vote
  - web frontend for users to vote dog/cat
  - ideally published on TCP 80. Container listens on 80
  - on frontend network
  - 2+ replicas of this container

- redis
  - redis:3.2
  - key-value storage for incoming votes
  - no public ports
  - on frontend network
  - 1 replica NOTE VIDEO SAYS TWO BUT ONLY ONE NEEDED

- worker
  - bretfisher/examplevotingapp_worker
  - backend processor of redis and storing results in postgres
  - no public ports
  - on frontend and backend networks
  - 1 replica

- db
  - postgres:9.4
  - one named volume needed, pointing to /var/lib/postgresql/data
  - on backend network
  - 1 replica
  - remember set env for password-less connections -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust

- result
  - bretfisher/examplevotingapp_result
  - web app that shows results
  - runs on high port since just for admins (lets imagine)
  - so run on a high port of your choosing (I choose 5001), container listens on 80
  - on backend network
  - 1 replica
